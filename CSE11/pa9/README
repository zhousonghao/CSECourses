Program Description:
  This program is designed to provide the constructor for 8 different shapes
in which contains shape.java and Arectrangle.java that function as a parent of 
all the other shapes excludes Point which is by itself in the hierachy. After 
providing all the necessary methods like getters,setters, constructors... we
have 2 test files names TestMickey and TestHouseWithDelays.java to test all the
methods that we've written. In order to run the TestMickey, we need compile all 
the other shaped by using command "javac -cp ./objectdraw.jar:. *.java" and 
then run the html using "appletviewer TestMickey.html" in the terminal. When
the applet has started, we will see a black Mickey with all its three circle's
cneter point printed out on the canvas. While we run the TestHouseWithDelays,
we use the same code "javac -cp ./objectdraw.jar:. *.java" but use " 
TestHouseWithDelays.html" to start the appletviewer instead. In this case,
the program will start to draw a house, start with house body, then chimney,
then roof frame, left window, 1st window pane, 2nd window pane, right window,
the door, door knob and finally filling the roof,by using all the shapes that
has implemented so far. At the mean time, all the kinds of shape with its 
position value will get printed out underneath the house that is drawn. 



Short Response ( 5 points ) : 
1. How would you test whether the copy constructors in the shape classes are 
   doing a deep copy instead of a shallow copy? 

   For example, given: 
   CSE11_Line l1 = new CSE11_Line(); 
   CSE11_Line l2 = new CSE11_Line(l1); 
   How would you test CSE11_Lineâ€™s copy constructor is doing a deep copy? 

   Ans: We can test whether this is a deep copy by comparing l2's start and end
        points are the same reference as l1's start and end points by using 
        "==" sign.
        Example: if(((CSE11_Line)l1).getStart() == ((CSE11_Line)l2).getStart()
                 ||((CSE11_Line)l1).getEnd() == ((CSE11_Line)l2).getEnd())  
                  {
                    String s = "\nYou implemented the CSE11_Line ctor with a 
                                  shallow copy.\n"  + "Should be deep copy!\n";

                    throw new IllegalStateException( s );
                  }

 
2. On a similar note, how would you test the equals() methods in each of
   the shape classes are doing deep comparisons instead of shallow reference 
   checks?  

   Ans: In order to check whether the shape has operated a deep copy, we can
        check all the contents that contain in that particular shape class.
        Example: say if the shape is a square

        square s1 = new square(); 
        square s2 = new square(s1); 

        if(((square)s1).getUpperLeft() == ((square)s2).getUpperLeft()
                 ||((square)s1).getSide() == ((square)s2).getSide())  
                  {
                    String s = "\nYou implemented the square ctor with a 
                                  shallow copy.\n"  + "Should be deep copy!\n";

                    throw new IllegalStateException( s );
                  }
